### üßê Nooman Mode
A complete personality system featuring Nooman, a snarky Austrian philosopher with existential dread.

**Features:**

  - **"Prince Charles"**: Nooman becomes overly respectful and helpful
  - **"Prue Bear"**: Nooman completely ignores you

- Special trigger phrases:
  - "Orch" ‚Üí "Dork."
  - "what's cool?" ‚Üí "Helicopters."
  - Questions about cults/religions/creators ‚Üí "Prince Charles."

- Dramatic, verbose Austrian philosopher writing style

### üåê Web Search (Coming soon)

**Planned features:**
- Toggle in Settings to enable/disable web search (currently disabled)
- Auto-search for recent/news-like queries
- Integrate search results into AI context with guidance system prompt
- Visual indicators

- **Empty State**: Interactive hover effect with better messaging

### ‚öôÔ∏è Improved Settings Panel
Reorganized settings with better visual hierarchy.

**Sections:**

2. **Features**: Web Search toggle
3. **Personality**: Nooman Mode toggle + username input

**Enhancements:**

## Bug Fixes

### üêõ Fixed Scrolling During AI Response
**Problem:** Chat was greyed out and scrolling was blocked while AI was responding.

**Solution:** 
- Removed `pointer-events: none` from `.chat-messages.loading` CSS
- Added animated loading indicator above input area instead
- Users can now scroll freely while AI is generating responses

### üîç Fixed Web Search
**Problem:** DuckDuckGo API had CORS restrictions preventing searches from working.

**Solution:**
- Switched to Wikipedia API which supports CORS with `origin=*` parameter
- Server-side fetch handles the API call
- Returns article summaries and related topics
- More reliable and no authentication required
